# Craindown

A markdown-like language with a simple, unambiguous spec. The goal is to be easy to parse, easy to use, and a bit simpler than markdown's gargantuan and varying specification. Math is also a first-class citizen, here, so inline math and "math blocks" are both supported by default.

This language has been constructed to suit exactly one person, namely, me. You can also use it if you want.

I guess it's ironic that the README has to be in markdown. Que sera sera...
